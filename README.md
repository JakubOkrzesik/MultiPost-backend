# MultiPost-backend
## About
Backend for MultiPost - an app enabling its users to post and manage multiple listings from multiple ecommerce websites at once (i.e. OLX and Allegro). Users authorize through their OLX and Allegro accounts and fill out a form to post listings. After the publication is successful users have the possibility of changing the price and deleting a given listing. The status of user listings is being tracked by the backend.
## Technologies used
Spring Boot, Apis of Olx and Allegro, MySQL, Amazon EC2, Docker
